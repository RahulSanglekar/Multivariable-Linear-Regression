# Multivariable-Linear-Regression
This is a multivariable Linear regression implementation.<br />
In this project we have been given 3 independent variables and a dependent variable.<br />
We train a linear model using the given data.<br />
1) Given the area, no. of bedrooms and age of a flat we need to predict the price of  3000sqft area,3 bedrooms ,40 year old house, and<br />
2) Given the experience, test_score and interview_score we need to predict the salary of a given experience, test_score and interview_score<br />
